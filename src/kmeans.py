# The end goal of a K-means algorithm is to find clusters in a dataset by decreasing the sum of squared errors from a number of k centroids.
# The following is the steps of the K-means algorithm:
# 1. Set the centroids to be random points in the dataset as much as k
# 2. Calculate the sum of squared deviations (errors) from the centroids
# 3. Assign a centroid to each point in the dataset
# 4. Calculate the new sum of total errors and compare it to the previous sum of total errors
# 5. If it's lesser, switch and recalculate the centroids.
# 6. Repeat :D
